Because real developers don't click things.

<br/>

ðŸ¤˜ Features

ðŸ§¬ Based on LazyVim, because I'm lazy but not stupid

âš¡ Clean, fast, and minimal â€” no 500-line init.lua rituals here

ðŸŽ¯ Tweaked just enough to suit my needs (which are superior, obviously)

ðŸŽ¨ Looks better than VSCode in the dark (and emotionally)

ðŸ’» 100% Linux-powered â€” btw I use Linux

ðŸ§¼ No custom keybinds... yet. Default gang rise up ðŸ™ƒ

<br/>

ðŸ§» Requirements

neovim >= 0.9

git

nerd-fonts (for icon supremacy)

A Unix system (Windows users, this is your sign)
